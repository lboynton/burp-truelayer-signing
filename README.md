## Before you start

Before you begin development, make sure that your project's JDK is set to version "21".

### Building the JAR file

To build the JAR file, run the following command in the root directory of this project:

* For UNIX-based systems: `./gradlew jar`
* For Windows systems: `gradlew jar`

If successful, the JAR file is saved to `<project_root_directory>/build/libs/<project_name>.jar`. If the build fails, errors are shown in the console. By default, the project name is `extension-template-project`. You can change this in the [settings.gradle.kts](./settings.gradle.kts) file.

## Loading the JAR file into Burp

To load the JAR file into Burp:

1. In Burp, go to **Extensions > Installed**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Under **Extension details**, click **Select file**.
4. Select the JAR file you just built, then click **Open**.
5. [Optional] Under **Standard output** and **Standard error**, choose where to save output and error messages.
6. Click **Next**. The extension is loaded into Burp.
7. Review any messages displayed in the **Output** and **Errors** tabs.
8. Click **Close**.

Your extension is loaded and listed in the **Burp extensions** table. You can test its behavior and make changes to the code as necessary.

### Reloading the JAR file in Burp

If you make changes to the code, you must rebuild the JAR file and reload your extension in Burp for the changes to take effect.

To rebuild the JAR file, follow the steps for [building the JAR file](#building-the-jar-file).

To quickly reload your extension in Burp:

1. In Burp, go to **Extensions > Installed**.
2. Hold `Ctrl` or `⌘`, and select the **Loaded** checkbox next to your extension.
